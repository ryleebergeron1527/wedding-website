        <h4>From their POV</h4>
        <ul class="wp-list">
          <li>Jack Crowe — Tyler gave me a beer at a party in college one time. Now I’m a groomsman? Nice to meet you! </li>
          <li>Max Gonzalez — I met Tyler on one of my first days of middle school. One of the only normal and sensible people I met at Mcquaid. From then on it's been the two of us against the world. Think of Jack and Rose standing on the front railing of the Titanic, arms spread wide (In this scenario I am Rose and Tyler is Jack). </li>
          <li>Peter Oliver — Tyler and I have tackled a litany of obstacles together, be it great or small. Living with Luke Maurice breaks weaker men, but we had each other to lean on while Maddie was miles away. We were always there for each other through thick and thin, in sickness and in health. In fact, It should probably be me up on the altar with him. Regardless, I owe my own marriage to Tyler “Heavy Hand” Bergeron and am honored to bear witness to this incredible matrimony. </li>
          <li>Leo Schneider — Tyler has taken me places I otherwise would only go to with a gun: a casino in Prague, Rochester, and anything to do with Notre Dame Club Volleyball. Unofficial, self-appointed 'insulin bearer' at the wedding.</li>
          <li>Luke Maurice — What do Bowser, Heat Miser, Thanos, and Tyler Bergeron have in common? All are large villains, many with red (sorry, strawberry blonde) hair. 
            And like any large villain of myth, film, or literature, Tyler’s epic story would never be truly fulfilled without a hero. Hi, I’m Luke, nice to meet me. 
            I have spent the last eight years since I first walked into Tyler’s freshman year dorm room in Keenan Hall as the anti-Berger.
            Jerry always escaped Tom, Mario always rescued Peach from Bowser, I always had just one more Natty Ice than Tyler. 
            Tyler has thrived in his time outside my shadow, progressing through medical school, marrying his soulmate, and, most importantly, achieving rank platinum 5 or higher in Overwatch 2 competitive play. 
            If you aren’t a friend of Peter Oliver’s, you’re a friend of mine! </li>
          <li>Mason McIntee — Tyler brought me Dairy Queen and asked if he could marry my sister. I’m better at golf than him. As Brian’s professional caddie, I spend more time with him than Tyler does with his own dad. </li>
          <li>Quinn Bergeron — Brother of groom. Younger than groom. Heavier than groom. I did not go to Notre Dame. The Best Man.
            Sitting Enthusiast. Aquarius. I was born on January 31st, 2002 weighing 9 pounds 11 ounces. I left the oven 2 days early and wasn’t supposed to arrive until February 2nd (2/2/2002). I wish that was the case because my old man Brian never fails to remind me how he wanted to call me “The Douce” (pretty awesome actually). Tyler and I met the day I was born (so I’m told). Growing up with Tyler was an interesting experience as he was reading the newspaper at the age of 5 and I have read 4 book. They say you’re supposed to learn from your older brother’s mistakes, but he might have learned a thing or two from me. Instead of trial and error of his own, I believe there were times I was a test subject he’d get to cause mischief and run social experiments… ironic now that he’s becoming a penile scientist. I spent most of my life living with the pretzel lover and wouldn’t want things any other way. 
            Also, I’m very excited to see him marry his first girlfriend. </li>
          <li>Will Harvey — Tyler’s former Vice President back in high school, which basically meant my job was to keep him from getting impeached. We were mock trial partners, volleyball teammates, and co-conspirators in all sorts of questionable decisions. I’ve also had a front-row seat to his ten-year run with Maddie — his Jackie Kennedy, keeping him looking sharp. And while Tyler and I have spent plenty of Sundays yelling at Bills games in some crowded NYC bar, I can say this is one of the rare times I know for sure he’s walking away as part of a winning team. </li>
          <li>Dominic Lamb — Height: 6’4” (7’2” if you count the hair). Occupation: International Underwater Firefighter / Freelance Falcon Whisperer. About Me: I was sent from the Lord above to bring entertainment to Tyler’s life. My first words were “I’ve known Tyler the longest here.” I rewatch the Notebook constantly and dont even tear up. I once stared at a grizzly bear until it ran off out of fear. Basically the full package. 1% man, 99% raw energy, and 200% math-deficient.</li>

        <h3 class="wp-column-title">Bridesmaids</h3>
        <h4>From Maddie's POV</h4>
        <ul class="wp-list">
          <li>Caroline Mollenkopf — Caroline and Maddie met in high school, where their first attempt at sneaking out- to the backyard, no less- failed immediately. Over the years, their friendship grew to also include Tyler, Max, Dom, and Bella. The group schemed their summers away, and every holiday you can find them back at Thirsty’s. Caroline swapped her rankings on Dartmouth's Women's Squash team for ranking Aperol Spritzes across Manhattan- a different kind of competition- yet just as intense. She has added so much joy to Maddie’s life and played a big role in keeping the proposal a surprise (“Want to make gingerbread houses after your brunch with Ty?!”). Caroline is the greatest listener, she’s empathetic, thoughtful, and always at the ready with a dose of humor. She never fails to know when it’s time to cue Forever by Chris Brown. Grounded, yet oh-so-supportive, Caroline celebrates and loves others so well, and Maddie feels so lucky to be one of them.</li>
          <li>Elisabeth Hanley — Bringing a sense of calm to every situation, it only makes sense that Elisabeth was the first friend Maddie made at Mercy. They should have been on the payroll for the amount of Admissions tours they led. Their summers were spent on Canandaigua Lake, and still are, whenever they both are in town. Luckily enough, Elisabeth also went to ND, so doing long distance with Tyler in college made for the best of both worlds. Although Elisabeth lives across the pond, she and Maddie make the most of their daily trans-Atlantic calls. Need a London tour guide? Elisabeth is your girl. She is the definition of a quality friend- incredibly trustworthy, quick-witted, honest, and dependable. She’ll drop anything for those closest to her and she makes those around her feel valued and loved. She also designed all the wedding stationery herself (architect perks!). </li>
          <li>Isabella Ponticello- — Bella and Maddie were introduced to each other through Caroline in 2018. When Bella moved back to ROC for some time during college, the two hit the ground running. Maddie loves telling the story of how her, Bella, and Meredith pulled a “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” on Bella’s (not so great) roommates, moving her out of her Park Ave house with a UHaul in a matter of two hours- without her roommates knowing until they came home. The two are always down for a nightcap but never miss pilates in the morning. Bella is thoughtful, resilient, and above all, compassionate and kind. She is heavily involved with AutismUp here in Rochester, a nonprofit organization very special to Maddie. <li>
          <li>Mackenzie Travis — Built-in besties as childhood neighbors, Mackenzie is Maddie’s first and longest friend. Their summers as kids were spent bouncing between backyards and their families pools, playing Ghosts in the Graveyard, and ‘teacher’ in their basements. As they grew up, playing “What Time Is It Mr. Fox” turned into attending every country concert they could at CMAC, and sipping margs on the patio with their moms. Now a pediatric nurse, ‘‘Kenny” (as Mason used to say), can be found saving lives in the Pediatric ED here in ROC, or raving at music festivals all over the U.S. Mackenzie livens up any room she enters and can make the most fun out of any situation. Maddie is so grateful to her mom and Mackenzie’s mom for fostering their friendship and loving each other like their own!</li>
          <li>Meredith Ramin — Meredith and Maddie met in their freshman year of college and lived together for two years, where they spent every weekend painting the town. Their favorite places to bop around were Dorado (for the margs), Dragonfly (for the pizza), and Magpie (for the darts), all steps from their apartment. Maddie’s favorite memory with Meredith is when the two spent their senior year spring break on a cruise through the Caribbean (that ship wasn’t ready for the amount of You Shook Me All Night Long they requested). Meredith is a special education teacher in Syracuse. She’ll charm you with her dive bar recs, commitment to justice, and her ability to dance through life, even when it gets hard. She knew her fiance, Brendan, was a keeper when she learned that he was a Type 1 diabetic, just like Tyler.</li>
          <li>Miranda Hughes — Maddie and Miranda met at Naz, bonding through Best Buddies and their shared passion for bringing more inclusion to campus. Miranda is the best- she tells it like it is, has never met a stranger, and is the *actual* life of every party she walks into. She’s the friend that brings out the more fun version of yourself.  Whether she’s leading a spin class at Compass in downtown ROC, or outdrinking you the night before, she gives 110% to everything—and everyone—around her. Everyone who knows Miranda knows she is committed, driven, a confidant, and oh-so-fun to be around. She’ll support you, listen to you, and will be your biggest hype woman. ‘Mimi’ is an acute care occupational therapist here in Rochester.</li>
          <li>Paige Burruto — Straight out of Gossip Girl, Paige lives in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and can be found sipping dirty martinis at the hottest cocktail bars in the city. She has restaurant managers' private cell numbers, meaning snagging a table is never an issue for her. By day, she’s hustling at Fox News; by Sunday, she and Maddie (try to) make it to church before cheering on the Bills in the city. They met in high school and are polar opposites. Maddie loves Paige’s spontaneity, humor, and fierce loyalty. She’s the kind of friend who goes well out of her way to make others feel loved. She has a story for everything, and will never fail to leave you laughing.</li>
          <li>Paige Pasquarella — Paige and Maddie met on their first day of college, sitting next to each other at orientation. Randomly, Maddie started tearing up over missing Tyler and had to explain this to the stranger (Paige) sitting next to her. They joked that they would laugh about this someday, and here they are! The girls are both SLP’s and brides to be! Whenever they’re together, time never passes and a third party comment is made about how they never stop talking. Maddie is a bridesmaid in Paige’s wedding next year and says that no one can fill people’s cups like Paige can. Genuine, loyal, and empathetic, everyone should have a Paige!</li>
          <li>Rylee Bergeron — Rylee keeps Maddie young- she is always up for a glass of Prosecco, a game of darts, or a night on the dance floor. One of her favorite memories is their self-declared “cookie crawl” across Manhattan, rating chocolate chip cookies like true pros. Maddie has loved watching Rylee grow up and shine in every area of her life, especially on the volleyball court. Maddie looks up to Rylee in more ways than one, and not just in height. She is a talented baker, ridiculously smart, and a loyal friend. Maddie is excited to *finally* get to call her family. As a computer science major, Rylee will graduate from the U of R just before the wedding and built this website from scratch!</li>
